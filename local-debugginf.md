# Local Debugging

You will need to do the following:
1. [Install conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/install/)
2. [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
3. [Install the AWS ClI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
3. [Setup a free AWS account for testing](https://aws.amazon.com/free)
4. [Configure AWS Terraform Authentication](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration)

With the above configured you should now be able to run terraform plans against your sample envirnment and run conftest against those plans. These steps are convered in the main [README.md](README.md).
